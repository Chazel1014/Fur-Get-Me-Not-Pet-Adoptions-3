##H2 Synopsis
A pet adoption site that focuses on the forgotten pets in your area. You won't find puppies, designer dogs or star-athletes in this search! We used the Google Maps API and petFinder API to narrow our search to the pets that have been waiting the longest to find their furever home. Some of these cats and dogs are elderly, disabled, disfigured or just forgotton. Our site is for owners who want to make a difference in their pets' lives!
